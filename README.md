# Secure Data Hiding in Images using Steganography
**Steganography** is the practice of hiding an image, message, or file within something that isn't a secret. It can be password protected as above or if one wants they can just embed the data without any password
## Feature
### Encryption:
Embed a secret text message into an image. The program writes each character's ASCII value into the image pixels and saves the modified image as a lossless JPG(or as you wish) file to preserve data integrity.
### Decryption:
Retrieve the hidden message from the encrypted image by providing the correct passcode and the message length.
## Requirements
1. Python
2. OpenCV
3. Very basic language knowledge
